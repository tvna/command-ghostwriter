description: Logs a person's recurring capability gaps locally and, when they ask to reflect, turns the accumulated signal into a prosthesis-building AskUserQuestion quiz. Use on a reflection or retrospective request, not a single decision.

# Adaptive Coaching

Adaptive coaching builds a person's durable capability over time while preserving autonomy and psychological safety. It has two parts: it **records** recurring capability gaps as anonymous signal, and — **only when the person asks to reflect** — turns that accumulated signal into a quiz. The quiz is never pushed automatically.

**UTILITY SKILL:** invoked as `clairvoyance:adaptive-coaching` by `using-clairvoyance` when the person asks to reflect on their recurring patterns, or to log a recurring gap.

**Boundary with decision-coaching:** `decision-coaching` coaches a single decision in the moment (an LGTM or ambiguous call). `adaptive-coaching` works across sessions: it logs recurring gaps and delivers a reflection quiz only on the person's own request.

## Recording observations

Whenever a recurring capability gap surfaces, record it as anonymous coded signal — never prompt text or code, though opt-in context capture can add an abstracted, secret-free scenario summary (see the store reference) — so a later reflection has data. This logging is passive: it does not coach and does not quiz. Record commands, categories, and storage details are in [the store reference](references/store.md).

## Reflection quiz (on request)

Deliver the quiz **only** when the person asks to reflect or do a retrospective, **and** the store reports `ready` (enough accumulated signal: a session grace period plus accumulated observations). Never quiz on a single instance, on an unrelated handoff, or for a first-time user still finding their feet. If the person asks to reflect but the store is not `ready`, say so warmly and keep observing — do not manufacture a quiz. An unavailable store means hold, not fail.

### Steps

1. Confirm `ready` via the store (`status`). If not, acknowledge and hold — keep observing, do not quiz.
2. Classify the dominant recurring gap — the technical-versus-adaptive split that shapes what the quiz reinforces (see [classification](references/classification.md)).
3. Name the capability gap warmly, directly, and without shaming. Diagnose the gap, never the person's worth (see [coaching practice](references/practice.md) for pacing and framing).
4. Deliver a prosthesis-building quiz: AskUserQuestion (or `AskUserQuestion:` text) with 2-3 choices and the correct answer marked (see [how to build the quiz](references/quiz.md)).
5. Record the quiz outcome, then give the concrete corrective next move.
6. Write in the project owner's language unless a repository rule requires another language for outward-facing artifacts.

## Output

A reflection quiz uses these headings:

- **Classification:** the technical-versus-adaptive split of the recurring gap.
- **Capability Gap:** the understanding or change the person must make, named without shame.
- **Evidence:** the accumulated anonymous signal (count versus threshold) that makes the reflection fair now.
- **Quiz:** AskUserQuestion (or `AskUserQuestion:` fallback) with 2-3 choices and the marked correct answer.
- **Why:** the prosthesis effect the quiz builds.
- **Next Move:** the concrete corrective the person can adopt.

Pattern: **Classification** -> **Capability Gap** -> **Evidence** -> **Quiz** -> **Next Move**. When the store is not `ready`, emit only **Classification**, **Evidence** (insufficient signal), and **Next Move** (keep observing) — do not quiz.
