# persist_session_path <dir>
#   Put <dir> on PATH for the current process and persist it for the rest of
#   the session. A no-op when <dir> is already on PATH. Otherwise it appends an
#   `export PATH="<dir>:$PATH"` line to $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE (when the harness set
#   one -- it is sourced before the first agent step) and exports the prefixed
#   PATH into the current process.
#
# This file is meant to be sourced, not executed: it only defines a function
# and has no side effects at source time, so it deliberately does not set shell
# options -- the sourcing script owns `set -euo pipefail`.
